```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(occPlus)
```

The model can be run using the `runOccPlus` function.

The arguments of the function are:

- data: which we explain below;
- d: number of factors;
- occCovariates: vector of the name of the covariates for the occupancy probabilities. 
- ordCovariates: vector of the name of the covariates for the ordination. 
- detCovariates: vector of the name of the covariates for the detection probabilities. 

## Data preparation

The data object is a list of two elements: `info` and `OTU`. 

`data$info` is a data.frame with $N$ rows, where $N$ is the total
number of replicates analyzed and columns:

- `Site`: name (or index) of the site in which this replicate was collected;
- `Sample`: name (or index) of the sample from which this replicate was analyzed;
- `Primer`: name (or index) of the primer used in this replicate;


```{r}
head(data$info)
```

`data$OTU` is a matrix of dimension $N \times S$, where $S$ is the number of 
species, where each element is the number of reads of the species in that replicate.
If data are missing, these can be coded as `NA`.

```{r}
head(data$OTU)
```

## Model fitting

Next, we can run the model by typing 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fitmodel  <- runOccPlus(data,
                        d = 2,
                        occCovariates = c("X_psi.1","X_psi.2"),
                        ordCovariates = c("X_ord.1","X_ord.2"),
                        detCovariates = c("X_theta"))

```


The names of the covariates in `occCovariates`, `ordCovariates` and `detCovariates`
should match the column name in data$info.

## Model selection

Model selection for the different factors $d$ can be done using the `loo` package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(loo)

fitmodel2  <- runOccPlus(data,
                        d = 3,
                        occCovariates = c("X_psi.1","X_psi.2"),
                        ordCovariates = c("X_ord.1","X_ord.2"),
                        detCovariates = c("X_theta"))

log_lik1 <- extract_log_lik(fitmodel$vb_fit)
log_lik2 <- extract_log_lik(fitmodel2$vb_fit)

loo1 <- loo(log_lik1)
loo1 <- loo(log_lik2)

comparison <- loo_compare(loo1, loo2)
print(comparison)
```

The model with elpd_diff equal to 0 is the one to be preferred

## Output

There are several outputs we can obtain:

### Covariates coefficients

We provide three functions for plotting occupancy, ordination and detection
covariate coefficients:

```{r}
plotOccupancyCovariates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:10, covName = "X_psi.1")
```

```{r}
plotOrdinationCovariates(fitmodel, covName = "X_ord.1")
```

```{r}
plotDetectionCovariates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:10, covName = "X_theta")
```

### Baseline rates

We can plot baseline occupancy rates via

```{r}
plotOccupancyRates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:20)
```

```{r}
plotCollectionRates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:20)
```


```{r}
plotDetectionRates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:20)
```

And false positives rates at the first stage (field stage):

```{r}
plotStage1FPRates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:20)
```

And at the second stage (lab stage):

```{r}
plotStage2FPRates(fitmodel, idx_species = 1:20)
```

### Occupancy rates

To compute occupancy probabilities at each site and for each species, we type

```{r, eval = F}
computeOccupancyProbs(fitmodel)
```

### Read intensity

`occPlus` estimates a distribution of reads for true and false positives. We can
plot the two distributions via:

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, warnings = FALSE}
plotReadIntensity(fitmodel)
```

### Covariance matrix

We can plot the posterior median of the residual correlation matrix as

```{r}
plotCovarianceMatrix(fitmodel)
```


We can show only the positively and negatively significant elements (positive in
red and negative in blue)

```{r}
plotSigElementsCovMatrix(fitmodel)
```

We note that this is the \textit{residual} covariance matrix, \textbf{after} 
accounting for occupancy covariates but accounting for ordination covariates.
